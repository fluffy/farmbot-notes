# Fluffy and Rory Adventures in FarmBot

My young friend, who also has the awesome name of Rory, and I have decided to try and build a farmbot. We find it very cool what you are building and the way you are trying to make it all open source. If it is OK with folks, we thought we would post  on this thread bits about our progress, challenges, what we are attempting to solve those, and  random ideas for cool improvements. The goal being to share info that would be useful to others and at the same time get help from the community. Huge thanks to my friend Rick who got me going on this. 


## Ordering Parts 

Let me just start by saying I can't wait till I can jut go to the farmbot.io online store click "send me the whole thing" and be done. Most the parts I got from the sites suggested in the documentation.  

We got the Plates from using the DXF file from 1.0 and had them cut by JP Metals in Calgary for approximately $200 US out of 3/16 aluminum. (not the 5mm in design). One thing we noticed is that seems to be missing the end bracket to mount the motors for the x axis. I think we will use the drawings from 1.0 to try and make one using a hacksaw and drill press. May try to cut with CNC router at some point. 

The 1.1 drawings have a nice bent mental version of the Z motor mount but I think we will try and 3d print the one from the 1.0 drawings instead. 

I have no idea if the stepper motors and encoders we got will work but we ordered the stepper motor from inventables part number 25253-01 (https://www.inventables.com/technologies/stepper-motor-nema-17)  and an AMT102-V encoder from digitkey (http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/cui-inc/AMT102-V/102-1307-ND/827015). How the encoder mounts on the mortor is still an "miracle happens here step" but we might try to glue the encoder on to the motor. Any advice appreciated.  The motor is a SM42HT47-1684B from smart automation (http://www.smartautomation.com.cn/ProductShow.asp?ArticleID=498). In looking for steppers, I found googling for 42HT47 useful as well as the page at  (http://reprap.org/wiki/NEMA_17_Stepper_motor)

To run the PI camera over an HDMI cable, I got the "Pi Camera HDMI Cable Extension" from  Petit Studio (https://www.tindie.com/products/freto/pi-camera-hdmi-cable-extension/ ). Perhaps a USB camera would be a better idea. Will see what happens. 

The RAMPS shield seemed to be out of stock most places but (http://www.sainsmart.com/) had them. All the stuff from sainsmart arrived quickly in nice case. I had not ordered  from them before but I will use them again.
